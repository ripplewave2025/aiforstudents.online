# AI for Students: Content Strategy & Workflow

This document outlines the content strategy, editorial guidelines, and workflow for establishing AI for Students as an authoritative voice in technology, AI, critical thinking, and future visions.

## 1. Content Mission

Our content aims to educate, inspire, and empower our audience to use AI effectively and ethically. We will create high-quality, practical, and thought-provoking content that helps people learn faster, think deeper, and prepare for a future shaped by technology.

## 2. Platform Strategy

We will use a multi-platform approach to reach our audience, with each platform serving a specific purpose.

- **Twitter/X:** For daily engagement, real-time commentary on tech news, and short-form educational content (threads).
- **YouTube:** for in-depth tutorials, visual explanations of complex AI concepts, and podcast-style discussions on the future of technology.
- **Tech Blog:** For long-form articles, tech journalism, and detailed tutorials that complement our YouTube videos.

## 3. Editorial Guidelines

All content must adhere to the **AI for Students Brand Style Guide**. In addition:

- **Accuracy:** All factual claims must be double-checked and sources cited where appropriate.
- **Clarity:** Write for a broad audience. Avoid jargon or explain it clearly.
- **Practicality:** Provide actionable advice and real-world examples.
- **Originality:** While we cover trends, our content must have a unique angle and provide fresh insights. We teach students to think, not copy, and our content should reflect that.

## 4. Content Calendar Template

We will use a weekly content calendar to plan and coordinate our efforts across platforms. This template can be used in a GitHub Project board or as a simple markdown file in the repository.

## 5. GitHub Workflow for Content Creation

We will use GitHub to manage our content pipeline from idea to publication.

1.  **Idea Generation (Issues):**
    -   Anyone can propose a new content idea by creating a GitHub Issue.
    -   Use labels to categorize ideas (e.g., `blog`, `youtube`, `twitter`, `podcast`).
    -   The issue should contain a brief description of the content, its target audience, and key talking points.

2.  **Content Development (Branches):**
    -   When an idea is approved, a feature branch is created from `main`.
    -   Branch naming convention: `content/[type]/[short-title]`.
        -   Example: `content/blog/5-ways-to-study-smarter-with-ai`
        -   Example: `content/youtube/script-for-chatgpt-tutorial`
    -   All work on the content (drafts, scripts, etc.) is done in this branch.

3.  **Review & Approval (Pull Requests):**
    -   When the content is ready for review, a Pull Request (PR) is opened.
    -   The PR description should link to the original issue.
    -   The team reviews the content for quality, accuracy, and adherence to brand guidelines.

4.  **Publication & Tracking (Project Boards):**
    -   Once approved, the content is published on its respective platform.
    -   The corresponding Issue and PR are moved to the "Done" column on our GitHub Project board.

## 6. Performance Measurement & Optimization

We will track the following metrics to measure the impact of our content and optimize our strategy.

-   **Engagement Rate:** Likes, comments, shares, retweets.
-   **Reach/Impressions:** How many people are seeing our content.
-   **Website Traffic:** Clicks from social media to `aiforstudents.online`.
-   **YouTube Subscribers & Watch Time:** Growth of our YouTube channel.
-   **Follower Growth:** Growth of our audience on each platform.

We will review these metrics monthly and adjust our content strategy accordingly.

## 7. Community Building Strategies

-   **Engage in Conversations:** Respond to comments and questions promptly.
-   **Ask Questions:** Use polls and open-ended questions to encourage interaction.
-   **Feature User-Generated Content:** Share and credit great content from our community.
-   **Collaborate with Influencers:** Partner with other tech educators and thought leaders.
-   **Be a Resource:** Actively look for opportunities to help people with their questions about AI and learning.
